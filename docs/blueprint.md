## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Champagne (#F7F2E7), a soft, light hue suggesting a neutral and bright tone, suitable as the background for other bolder elements.
- Background color: Aquarelle blush (#F3E9E7), very closely related in hue to the primary, almost fully desaturated for a quiet, bright backdrop.
- Accent color: Sage (#CFE2D0), which offers a subtle analogous accent. Noticeably different in brightness and saturation.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for titles and headings to bring elegance, paired with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure legibility.
- Use thin, consistent line icons to complement the elegant watercolor aesthetic.
- Implement a modular one-page layout with clear section divisions, optimized for mobile-first responsiveness (minimum 375px).
- Incorporate subtle microinteractions like fade/scale transitions and minimal parallax effects for an engaging user experience.
